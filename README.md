This repository is an introduction to the developer and programming world through GitHub. 

I'm Juan Nieto. I living in Bogot√°, Colombia. I would like to learn about programming for data science and data analytics. I understand that platforms like GitHub facilitates the processes about these topics and help the project with the work teams.
